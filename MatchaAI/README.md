# 🤝 Acknowledgments 
Inspired by mental health advocacy initiatives. I personally struggle with my mental health when I go through a rough patch and I know many of us do as well! I wanted to make a cute welcoming bot that you could go to to make yourself feel a little bit better. 

Built using FastAPI, LlamaIndex, and Ollama.
